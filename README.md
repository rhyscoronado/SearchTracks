# coding-challenge

Note
This project was created for a technical exam, this will be further improved to showcase what I can offer so far as an Android Developer

Framework Included
1. RxJava2
2. Dagger2
3. Retrofit2
4. OkHttp3
5. Navigation Component
6. Room

Persistence
Room was used to data persistence, not only because itÕs the recommended library, but because I personally understood how it removes boilerplate codes and the queries are even checked during compile time. 

App Usage:
This was used on the app to store the track list after downloading it from the API. This allows the app to be used offline as the data will still be there even without internet.

Architecture
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is the design pattern used to build this to separate the layers and entities from each other specially logicÊClean Architecture. This also followsÊSOLID PrincipleÊfor a better de-coupling and structure of the app.
